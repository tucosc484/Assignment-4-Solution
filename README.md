# Assignment 4 Solution

Here you will find my solution for Assignment 4. Be sure to read the JSDoc comments inside of the PostService and understand the use of HttpClient, the RxJS map operator, and string interpolation.

Additionally, here I used the [ActivatedRoute](https://angular.io/api/router/ActivatedRoute) service provided by Angular to fetch the post ID from the route when navigating to the details page. We first introduced this service in the [Routing Demo](https://github.com/tucosc484/RoutingDemo).

#### What are those emojis??
